Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors. 

Weather Conditions:

Observation: The majority of accidents occur under normal weather conditions.
Conclusion: Weather conditions may not be the primary contributing factor to accidents in this dataset. However, it is crucial to consider how adverse weather might exacerbate accident risk when it occurs.

Road Conditions:

Observation: Accidents frequently occur on asphalt roads.
Conclusion: Since most accidents happen on asphalt roads, it could indicate high traffic volumes on these roads rather than a particular risk associated with the road surface itself. Further analysis could compare accident rates to traffic volumes.

Light Conditions:

Observation: A significant number of accidents occur during daylight.
Conclusion: Daylight conditions see more accidents, possibly due to higher traffic volumes during the day. However, accidents occurring in darkness suggest the need for better lighting and visibility measures.

Accident Severity:

Observation: The dataset contains varying levels of accident severity.
Conclusion: Understanding the distribution of accident severity can help prioritize safety measures. For instance, if severe accidents are more frequent under certain conditions, those areas should be targeted for improvements.

General Observations:

The data reveals critical insights into when and where accidents occur most frequently.
Factors such as weather, road, and light conditions influence accident occurrences but might be interlinked with traffic volume and driver behavior.
